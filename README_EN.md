# Data Analysis Project

This data analysis project is divided into several classes and includes tutorial files, Jupyter notebooks, and datasets for practice and analysis. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience with Python, data analysis, and visualization.

## üî® Project Features

- **Lesson 1:** Introduction to basic Python concepts and data analysis.
- **Lesson 2:** Continuation with advanced techniques and data manipulation.
- **Lesson 3:** Data analysis with real datasets and visualization.
- **Lesson 4:** Application of advanced analysis techniques and data interpretation.

### Project Visual Example

*No specific visual example is available, but you can see the progress and analyses performed in the provided Jupyter notebooks.*

## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and Technologies Used

- **Python:** Main programming language used for data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment for creating and sharing documents with executable code, visualizations, and text.
- **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Libraries for data visualization.
- **NumPy:** Library for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **pyautogui:** Library for automation of mouse and keyboard control.
- **pyperclip:** Library for clipboard manipulation.
- **time:** Module for time manipulation and delays.
- **selenium:** Library for web browser automation.
- **webdriver_manager:** Library for managing browser drivers for Selenium.
- **scikit-learn:** Library for machine learning and predictive analysis.
- **cx-Freeze:** Library for creating executables from Python scripts.

  - `Arquivo Inicial - Aula 4.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with lesson exercises.
  - `advertising.csv`: Dataset in CSV format.
  - `novos.csv`: Another dataset in CSV format.

- **Other Files:**
  - `.gitignore`: File to ignore unnecessary files/directories in version control.
  - `LICENSE`: Project license file.
  - `PywinautoNotepadAuto.ipynb`: Additional Jupyter Notebook with automated scripts for Notepad.
  - `README.md`: This file with project documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Open and Run the Project

To start working with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - **Install Python:** Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - **Install Dependencies:** Use `pip` to install the required libraries. In the terminal or command prompt, execute:

     ```bash
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy jupyter pyautogui pyperclip selenium scikit-learn cx-Freeze webdriver-manager
     ```

2. **Prepare Working Environment:**
   - **Clone the Repository:** If the project is in a Git repository, clone it to your system with:

     ```bash
     git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
     ```

   - **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

     ```bash
     cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
     ```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   - In the terminal, within the project directory, start Jupyter Notebook with:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

   - This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default browser, showing all project files.

4. **Open and Run Notebooks:**
   - Navigate to the desired lesson folder in the Jupyter interface.
   - Open the file `Arquivo Inicial - Aula X.ipynb`.
   - Execute the notebook cells in the presented order to follow the exercises and analyses described.

5. **Work with Datasets:**
   - For analysis with datasets, load CSV and Excel files directly in the notebooks using pandas. Examples of how to do this are available in the provided notebooks.

6. **Save and Export Results:**
   - After completing the exercises, you can save your progress and export notebooks as HTML or PDF via Jupyter Notebook options to share or review your work.

## üåê Deploy

*There is no specific deploy for this project as it is focused on analysis and learning in a local environment. However, you can share your notebooks and exported results as needed.*
